Bootstrap Components:
The components that I have used are cards for the images since it is easir to implement in the website. 
I used a carousel for the images since in Instagram, you can upload lots of pictures in one post. 
In the individual icons, I used a class for small images and I only added he radius to make it circle since it is like that in Instagram.
Bootstrap components such as navbar, cards, grids, and the icons makes it easir to create the instaclone since it can be browsed in the internet.
